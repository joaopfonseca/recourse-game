# Recourse Game

**recourse-game** is a Python module designed for algorithmic recourse built
on top of Scikit-Learn and is distributed under the MIT license.

This repository contains the original implementation of the agent-based

Recourse Over Time" by Fonseca et al.

This repo is currently under active development and more features are expected
to be added in the future.
