# Recourse Equalization Across Groups

This directory contains the implementation of Gupta, V., Nokhiz, P., Roy, C. D., & Venkatasubramanian, S. (2019). Equalizing recourse across groups. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.03166.

The code for this implementation was found originally in https://github.com/vgupta123/recourse-equalization/tree/master

This mitigation strategy is also implemented in the multi agent-based algorithmic recourse simulation framework proposed in Fonseca, J., Bell, A., Abrate, C., Bonchi, F., & Stoyanovich, J. (2023). Setting the Right Expectations: Algorithmic Recourse Over Time. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.06969.
